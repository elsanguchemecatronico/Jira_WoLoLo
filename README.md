# Jira Work Log Logger
The Jira Work Log Logger (or WoLoLo, for those who recall playing AoE) is an app (still in development) to help everyone streamline daily time tracking tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> For now, the app will only allow you to upload work logs in issues you already have work logs. This is a safety measure.
